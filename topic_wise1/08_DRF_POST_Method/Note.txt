=> if we will go to url:
    -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
    -> then we might will going to see 'TemplateDoesNotExist' that is because we have not followed the documentation for adding rest_framework so,
    -> firstly we will add rest_framework as installed app in settings.py
    ->  INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'rest_framework',
    ]

=> after this we will create the views for "POST" method inside 'api/views.py' 
=> after we will post request by sending data from client side we can serialize that data that is being send from the client side and validate that data

NOTE: serializer & views are most critical thing in DRF
