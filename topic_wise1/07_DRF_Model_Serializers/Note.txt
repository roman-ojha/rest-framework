=> before serializing model we will first create the property of the product model 'sale_price' after creating it:
    -> python manage.py shell
    -> from products.models import Product
    -> Product.objects.first().sale_price
        -> '0.00'
    -> Product.objects.last().sale_price
        -> '0.00'

=> after this we will create a model serializers
    -> first create file 'serializers.py' inside products
    -> after we serializer the Product we will bet able to access it's property as well like 'sale_price'

=> after creating property of the model & serialized that model instance we will going to response serialized model instance from 'api/views.py'
