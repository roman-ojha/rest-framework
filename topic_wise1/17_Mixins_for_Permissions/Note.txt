=> now the first thing that we will going to do is to move the 'products/permissions.py' file to 'api/' folder
=> because we want to use that permission throughout the all 'api/' endpoint
=> now we will going to create 'api/mixins.py' file and create mixin there
=> now we will add that mixins into 'products/views.py'

=> NOTE that we wan use mixins for every thing that you don't want to repeat you can make mixins of that
