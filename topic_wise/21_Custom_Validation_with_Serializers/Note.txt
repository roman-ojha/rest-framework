=> Now we will going to add custom validation with serializers
=> there is a different approach for this 
=> the simple approach is in any kind of the serializer for that we pick the field that we want to validate our data from
=> another way to validate it by create new module file call 'validators.py'
    -> validators are useful in many context
    -> not just for the rest framework but you can create validators for model, model forms
    -> NOTE that if you already have the validator on the model then you don't have to create the validator for django rest framework serializer
