*) Permission:
    -> we will going to add 'permission_classes' on APIViews in 'products/views.py'

*) Authentication:
    -> we ca use 'authentication_classes' again on APIViews in 'products/views.py'
    -> but first we will create a superuser
        -> python manage.py createsuperuse
    -> after that we will get login using admin:get
    -> after we will get login we have session authenticated now we can access to the APIViews where user need to authenticate
    -> but NOTE: only if we will try to get access through website page it will get authenticated but if we will try to access APIView from 'py_client' then it is not authenticated
    -> so, we have to way to access from 'py_client' using:
        -> first login to admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
        -> then then having a session
        -> and using that session to request to the endpoint
        -> it would be done through like : 'selenium' which will allow to keep that session to emulate the browser
    -> But previous method is not ideal for vast majority of apis
    -> for that we would rather use token authenticate so that py_client will easily be able to authenticate
