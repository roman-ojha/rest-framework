=> https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/settings/
=> within rest framework we can set some default setting so that django rest framework will go through those default setting
=> like we can se default authentication or permission
=> Now we will going to add some code inside settings.py for default authentication and permission:
    -> auth_class = [
        "rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication",
        "api.authentication.TokenAuthentication",
    ]
    if DEBUG:
        auth_class = [
            "api.authentication.TokenAuthentication",
        ]
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": auth_class,
        "DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES": [
            "rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly"
        ]
    }

=> if we want to override these authentication and permission we can do that inside individual views
=> so we will going to override permission class inside 'products/views.py'
