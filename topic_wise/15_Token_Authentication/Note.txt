=> so inside 'cfehome/setting.py' we will add:
    -> INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'rest_framework.authtoken',
    ]
=> python manage.py migrate
=> now we will create a endpoint to generate the auth_token inside 'api/urls.py'
    => urlpatterns = [
        path('auth/', obtain_auth_token),
    ]
=> now we will add 'TokenAuthentication' inside 'products/views.py'
=> now inside the 'py_client' we will create 'auth.py' for token based authentication
=> after that we will add that auth function inside 'list.py' so that can have permission to access the APIView using token based authentication

=> on header while authenticating user "Token" keyword is rest_framework default way to authenticate but if we want to change that keyword to 'Bearer' then we can do that by:
    => we will going to create 'authentication.py' inside 'api/' and override the keyword
