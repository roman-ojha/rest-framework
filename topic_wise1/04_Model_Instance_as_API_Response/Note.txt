=> Now we will going to create a django model and respond on our api home view with the instance of that model
*) Create app first and make model for that app:
    -> python .\manage startapp products
    -> INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'products'
        ]
    => After created model:
        -> python .\manage.py makemigrations
        -> python .\manage.py migrate
    => now we will run django shell to add item:
        -> python manage.py shell:
            -> from products.models import Product
            -> Product.objects.create(title='Hello world', content='this is content', price=0.00)
            -> Product.objects.all().order_by("?").first()
                -> get different model

*) Response back create data to client:
    -> first we will add logic to response model data inside 'views.py'
    -> then we will request model from py_client
