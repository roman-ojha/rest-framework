=> So now we will add token based authentication so that our 'py_client' can talk to rest-framework
=> so inside 'cfehome/setting.py' we will add:
    -> INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'rest_framework.authtoken',
    ]
=> python manage.py migrate
=> now we will create a endpoint to generate the auth_token inside 'api/urls.py'
    => urlpatterns = [
        path('auth/', obtain_auth_token),
    ]
=> now we will add 'TokenAuthentication' inside 'products/views.py'
=> now inside the 'py_client' we will create 'auth.py' for token based authentication
