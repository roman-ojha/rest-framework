=> Here we will going to implement basic search of the product
=> first we will add new 'public' field on product model 'products/model.py'
=> after that we will make a migration:
    -> python manage.py makemigrations
    -> python manage.py migrate
=> now we will create a new app for search:
    -> python manage.py startapp search
    -> we had create the new app so that we want to separate view from other views
    -> then we will add that search app onto install app on 'cfehome/settings.py'
=> now we will implement urls & views for search app
=> and we will add that search urls into our main url on 'cfehome'
=> now we will search like this:
    -> http://localhost:8000/api/search/?q=hello
